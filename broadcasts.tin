Broadcasting Network [Ryloth (Private Signal)]: The holovid frames a wide aerial view of a canyon. It follows a lone holospeeder as the driver, sporting a red beret, turns sharply into a rosey-rock tinted alcove where dozens of similar crimson outfits begin to wave during their duties. The Gamorrean in the car smiles and waves back to all. "Hi comrade", he greets the human. "Hi comrade!" they reply. The driver nods to a fuel attendant. "Hi comrade" "Hi comrade," replies the Twi'lek. His boxy retro speeder continues down the village as two engineers build a pipeline. A Corellian pop-music track peaks as they look up excited. "Hi comrades" he greets them, and they harmonize "Hi comrade!" as a ship lifts in the background. The Gamorrean turns to face, and gives his best try at a soft smile. "Am comrade" he asserts. ", and you..?" The camera tilts to view the dusty horizon with bold text. The United Socialist Republic of Ryloth. Channel 7

Broadcasting Network [Mon Cala (Private Signal)]: An upbeat, orchestral score accompanies a vast, bird's-eye shot of Heurkea City, filmed via holo-cam droid, taking in the beauty of the seas lapping against the architectural marvel. The perspective then rapidly craters towards the South-Eastern section of the city before cutting to the interior of a cozy restaurant with bustling chatter and local pop music audible in the background. Standing in the middle of the room is a purple-skinned Mon Calamari male adorned with a bulky, stained chef's apron and a towering, lop-sided toque. Aged well beyond his years and smiling with wearily outstretched arms, he looks right into the camera and exclaims "Welcome to Corbus' Pizza Corner! Grand Opening TODAY right here on Dac! With a starting pie lineup featuring Grolmf's Supreme, Seafood Spectacular, Sweet Heat, Meat Lover's, and Veggie Delight, you're sure to find a new favorite. Come get them before they're gone!"

"This message goes to the one known as Husher. Contact me at @98183." The camera feed then cuts out, returning to your regularly schedule programming.

Broadcasting Network [Corellia]: The holo broadcast opens to A gruff, reddish brown skinned Besalisk in grey, four armed engineers coveralls. He sits at a desk strewn with data slates, paperwork, and records. Looking to the camera, he smiles and says, "Hey Corellia and beyond. Planetary Governor Baxxter Boggs here. Hope everyone's having a great day today. We got to see a wonderful Pazaak tournament run by Voxen at Little Skully on Wroona, with Xeni taking the prize, so if you've got time, see if you can find a recording of the Holo floating around." His expensive corellian cigar is smoldering in an ashtray as he taps through some things on his datapad. "In local news, we've got plenty of space for new business here on Corellia, and I've got five spots open that I'll pay the 200k credits for your shop fee out of our Corellian Business Development Fund. On that note, come by and look at Sophae's, a shop run by our good friend Falease. When I stopped by there earlier today there were some Carapace pieces in there, a plate carrier, and a nice looking vibroblade. Get them while supplies last!"
Broadcasting Network [Corellia]: After a small burst of static, the broadcast continues: He reaches for the cigar with one of his four hands as two of them work the datapad, and another one looks over some papers on the desk as he blows a billowing cloud of smoke out, mulling over records, "To catch you all up to speed on Corellian Government things, I've gotten a few replies back from residents, and there's some good input here about not being a fething gundark's hind, so I'm taking good feedback from our citizens. Today I launched the inagural run of the Corellian Academy Supply Hauler, or C.A.S.H. I bought an old Freighter named 'FreightyCat', and an enterprising lady out of the Academy is going to haul cargo for no charge, as long as she keeps Corellia in that trade route. If you want to be part of the CASH program, mail to Baxxter and we'll see if we can get you in the rotation." As he taps through his datapad, $n gets to the end of his list and nods to himself, "Well, that's what I got for today. Welcome home, Corellians." After a few more puffs of the cigar, the holo cuts it's broadcast.

"I am Nadie Ruk-Sienar. For years I've been finding myself playing a role in galactic politics, it started accidentally while I was at Sienar Fleet Systems just trying to be a cargo pilot. It continued as I helped as leader of Sienar Corporation until my departure to start the Rebel Alliance and help lead the takedown of the greatest threat to political decency in recent history. Now, in this time of the fledgling Galactic Alliance I am forced to step down from a leadership role. Unfortunately, it seems that I have a medical condition that will be taking the time and energy that leadership requires I normally put into the Galactic Alliance." She clasps her hands in front of her, "Not everybody will be saddened by my resignation and to those that look on it with favor I have nothing to say. To those I am counting on to carry on what I have sacrificed and risked so much to build with my compatriots I say that I have faith in you. Through good management, a lack of ego, and patience, the virtues that brought us to this point, the Galactic Alliance can build a beautiful community. I know that I will be okay, and that I will live long enough to see that community, which I am certain will flourish, reach its potential."

Broadcasting Network [Wroona (Private Signal)]: The scene opens from a bird's-eye view setting of lush, green, rolling hills, far above the form of two men at the edge of a reflective lake. A synthesized pop beat begins, with a constant, driving, peppy beep bop boop bop, beep bop boop bop drums typical of Sparkle Bop.   The rhythm builds up as the view zooms-in on them, showing their full, average-sized human-like forms, each clad in a jacket of hardened voritor scales, pale faces peppered with black stubble shadows. Only their hair differs as the one on the left has raven-black with blue streaks and the other has deep-cerulean-blue with purplish streaks.   They face each other with expressions of wonder, as the first man breaks into song: "Isn't it strange?". The second joins in, staring at the first: "Feels like I'm lookin' in the mirror."   He continues, "What would people say ...?" The first finishes the thought, "if only they knew that I was - part of some geneticist's plan."   As the pace increases, the men face front and shake their hips laterally in sync. The second nods to agree, "Born to be a carbon copy man."   The first man resumes relaying his plight, "There in a petri dish late one night. They took Danny's right toe and fertilized a Balosar egg and so I say ..."   His thoughtful face is zoomed in on. "I think I'm a clone now." The head of one referred to as Danny pushes in, cheek-to-cheek, "There's always two of me just a-hangin' around."   The first repeats, "I think I'm a clone now." They exclaim in unison, as if they share one voice: "Cause every chromosome is a hand-me-down!".     As the scene fades to black, a bright text appears: * * * This Holovid brought to you by X Marked Productions, starring Thanny and Danny of Pulsar Interstellar Industries. * * *

Broadcasting Network [Arkania (Private Signal)]: An eight sided star appears on the screen. The ends are arrows and they expand out infinitely over a backdrop of the galaxy, starting at Ryloth. Slow, heavy guitar starts playing. Several dangerous animals flash over the screen. The guitar picks up, getting louder as drums and bass join in. A man of white skin, silver locks, and grey eyes steps into view of the camera as the backdrop fades. An overly excited Jawa with him. "Ive got stuff for sale." The ragged voice proclaims. The jawa runs towards the camera and shouts " Lylek sets!" The camera rises up to the male, "Hunted goods." The jawa jumps up and grabs the camera, "Dhid earrings!" she says loudly. "Basic gear." the white, vitiligo patched man says. "Coats and chains!" the jawa squeals. "And Krayt apparel." "PEARLS!" the jawa runs back to the man and together they shout. "All at The Rasping Voice" the screen returns to the galaxy wide expanse of the star as it zooms out to show the the star continuing to spread into the unknown regions of space. The music comes to a slow stop, and the screen fades to black.

Slow, heavy guitar starts playing. Several dangerous animals flash over the screen. The guitar picks up, getting louder as drums and bass join in. A man of white skin, silver locks, and grey eyes steps into view of the camera as the backdrop fades. An overly excited Jawa with him. "Ive got stuff for sale." The ragged voice proclaims. The jawa runs towards the camera and shouts " Lylek sets!" The camera rises up to the male, "Hunted goods." The jawa jumps up and grabs the camera, "Dhid earrings!" she says loudly. "Basic gear." the white, vitiligo patched man says. "Coats and chains!" the jawa squeals. "And Krayt apparel." "PEARLS!" the jawa runs back to the man and together they shout. "All at The Rasping Voice" the screen returns to the galaxy wide expanse of the star as it zooms out to show the the star continuing to spread into the unknown regions of space.

Broadcasting Network [GNI Report]: [GNI Report]: [ Emotional Farewell As Nadie Ruk-Sienar Steps Back from Alliance Leadership ] In a poignant address from the Parliamentary Hall of The Galactic Alliance, Nadie Ruk-Sienar announced her resignation as the leader of the Galactic Alliance, citing a recent medical diagnosis. This announcement marks a momentous shift in galactic politics. Nadie has been a stalwart figure for years, first as a founder of the Liberation Union that provided an early resistance to the Galactic Empire, and then the unified Rebel Alliance through the Galactic Civil War. "To those I am counting on to carry on what I have sacrificed and risked so much to build with my compatriots I say that I have faith in you," Nadie said in her speech. "Through good management, a lack of ego, and patience, the virtues that brought us to this point, the Galactic Alliance can build a beautiful community. I know that I will be okay, and that I will live long enough to see that community, which I am certain will flourish, reach its potential." Nadie's legacy looms large across the galactic landscape, and many are left wondering who will fill the void. Stay tuned to GNI for updates.

Thick durasteel hull in the same gray as its predecessors, matching the duracrete of the city but being gentler, more organic. "The Imperial Order exists because The Galactic Empire was handed defeat and shown mercy. The Imperial Order has been given warnings, and they have pledged to avoid the intelligent choice.

The long-anticipated conflict between the The Imperial Order and the Confederacy of Independent Systems has arrived as the uneasy cold war went hot over the continued Imperial occupation of Kashyyyk. Tensions have been brewing for months as the resurgent Imperial Remnants - lead by the mysterious Sith Lords - gobbled up territory, going as far as to appoint a Trandoshan governor to oversee the Wookiee homeworld, a highly controversial move that has remained at the center of the conflict. A short time before hostilities went hot, CIS leadership issued an immediate ban on Imperial personnel and starships from both CIS sectors and Mytaranor space. The fragile peace established by the Mon Cala Accords several years ago is now a but a distant memory as the CIS and Imperial Order muster their forces for the battles ahead.
